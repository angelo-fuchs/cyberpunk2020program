# Cyberpunk 2020

This program is the attempt to solve our gaming needs with software.
Currently the code is horrible, incomplete and overall not good.

As soon as it gets to a useable state, I will change this readme.

## Dependencies

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

## CLI Commands

``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
yarn dev

# build for production with minification
yarn build

# test the production build locally
yarn serve
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [CLI Readme](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli/blob/master/README.md).
